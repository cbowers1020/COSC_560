Questions: 
- I asked a question in regards to his self driving car safety question?
- Question about output space verification providing feedback into training the NN better to be more resilient to perturbation attacks.

Safety properties are of primary interest

Some reachability properties

LEC Verification

From some set of input and a resulting output set, see if output set is in property space

RELU network can compute layer by layer
