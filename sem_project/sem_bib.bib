@article{Martina2015,
	Abstract = {Multicast, originally designed as an efficient way of broadcasting content, is being used in security protocols. Multicast security protocols are difficult to verify using model checking because they typically involve a large number of participants. Likewise, the exponential growth of knowledge being distributed during protocol run is a challenge. From a specification point of view, multicast is also a general way of representing message casting in protocol verification, with unicast, anycast and broadcast as special cases. Using the inductive method of protocol verification and Isabelle/HOL, we have devised techniques for specifying multicast protocols and proving many of their essential properties. We show backwards compatibility revisiting a well-known protocol and secrecy proofs for a mixed environment protocol as a case study. Our contributions are twofold: a usable multicast specification using the inductive method and the assertion that protocols should be verified by default using a multicast specification.},
