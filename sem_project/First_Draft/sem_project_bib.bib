@article{Martina2015,
	Abstract = {Multicast, originally designed as an efficient way of broadcasting content, is being used in security protocols. Multicast security protocols are difficult to verify using model checking because they typically involve a large number of participants. Likewise, the exponential growth of knowledge being distributed during protocol run is a challenge. From a specification point of view, multicast is also a general way of representing message casting in protocol verification, with unicast, anycast and broadcast as special cases. Using the inductive method of protocol verification and Isabelle/HOL, we have devised techniques for specifying multicast protocols and proving many of their essential properties. We show backwards compatibility revisiting a well-known protocol and secrecy proofs for a mixed environment protocol as a case study. Our contributions are twofold: a usable multicast specification using the inductive method and the assertion that protocols should be verified by default using a multicast specification.},

	Abstract = {Real-Time Maude is a language and tool supporting the formal specification and analysis of real-time and hybrid systems. The specification formalism is based on rewriting logic, emphasizes generality and ease of specification, and is particularly suitable to specify object-oriented real-time systems. The tool offers a wide range of analysis techniques, including timed rewriting for simulation purposes, search, and time-bounded linear temporal logic model checking. It has been used to model and analyze sophisticated communication protocols and scheduling algorithms. Real-Time Maude is an extension of Maude and a major redesign of an earlier prototype.},
